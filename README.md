Sprint 2: Android Frontend 
---------------

There was a complete redesign of the backend for sprint 2. Our team was succesfully able to create objects, that we would be able to use for our frontend.

There are two different applications that were made for this sprint: The Driver App and the Passenger App.

When starting both applications, you will be start at a login page, where a user will put in their username and password. After you put in your username and password, please click on the login button to be added to the database. 

Please ignore the continue button in the driver app
------------------------
When drivers click login, they will be faced with 3 buttons they may choose from: Create Route, Rate Passenger, and Route List. 

When drivers go to the create route page, they can create an ad for a journey that they will be taking. They may include the start city, the end city, the price to join the trip, the available seats, the vehicle, and the date that the journey will take place on. After clicking create route, the route will be added to the database, for passengers to join.
When drivers go to the rate passenger page, they may give a passenger a rating out of 5.
Next, a driver can go see all the routes he has. When you click the "Get routes" button, all of the routes he is taking will display on the screen. A driver may end a route here as well by inserting an ID specific to that route. It does not always refresh right away so you may have to go back a page, then go back to the get routes page. After you click the "Get Routes" button, the deleted route will be gone. 

When passengers login, they will be faced with 3 buttons they may choose from: Find Route, Rate Driver, and My Routes.
When passengers go to the find route page, they will be able to search ads for a journey that they will be taking.They will unput the start and end cities in which they wish to travel to, and the date they wish to take the trip. They will then see the routes that meet their needs, and can join whichever one they wish by inserting the route id, and clicking join route. If there are no seats available, they will not be able to join the route. 
A passenger can go to the rate driver page to give a driver a rating out of 5.
Next, a passenger can go see all the routes he has. When you click the "Get routes" button, all of the routes he is a part of will display on the screen. A passenger may leave a route here as well by inserting an ID specific to that route. It does not always refresh right away so you may have to go back a page, then go back to the get routes page. After you click the "Get Routes" button, the route you left should be gone.
